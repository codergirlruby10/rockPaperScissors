Rock Paper Scissors Game

# Description
Rock Paper Scissors game simulator. Computer uses a random number generator to come up with either rock paper or scissors. The computer does not display its answer until 
after the user inputs their move.  

# Status
Will probably add a do-while loop to keep the game going for more than one round. Will also probably use .ignoreCase so that when user puts their move it wont matter if
it is capitalized or not. This project was meant to practice creating and calling methods.
